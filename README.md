# Muze

  Muze is a work in progress social media platform. We aim to connect musicians and bands to venues via the Internet.

## For Musicians

  Musicians will be able to create accounts to upload samples of their work, via either video or pure music formats. This will be found in their personal profile.

## For venues

  Venues will be able to create a profile and a listing displaying details regarding their venue.

## For both

  There will be mutliple ways of connecting with for the two parties to connect with each other and register interest. More to come.

# Progress so far

  So far local user and facebook authentication has been added, alongside simple database integration. Some basic HTML and CSS styling has also added.

## Tech Stack

  MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node.js)

## To come

* Ability to upload videos and music
* Ability to create a venue listing
* Separation of musician and venue profile
* and more....
